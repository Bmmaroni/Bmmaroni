### Hi there 👋

Hey my name is Brandon. I spend time pondering the mysterious and unique facets of life because I believe we often choose not to notice all that is around us. I seek out new,  random and interesting facts because you can always learn more. I bring this same perspective along with me when I code! Coding is a new found passion of mine because the more I learn the more powerful I feel. 🖥️🧙‍♂️
